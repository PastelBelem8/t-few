Cesc fabregas returns to arsenal on sunday and arsene wenger hopes fans will give him a good reception . Wenger wants ` respect ' for the club 's former players and counts fabregas as a man who deserves that . Gunners fans offer their good luck to fabregas in 2011 , but the reception is likely to be more frosty this time . Extreme , perhaps , but this is an emotive issue which continues to bubble away at the club where fabregas built his career , not least because the circumstances behind his summer move from barcelona to chelsea are still as clear as mud . Any clarity , it seems , will have to wait . Wenger was at his cryptic best on thursday when asked if it was his call to not take up an option he had to re - sign the player , saying : ` we will have to discuss that one day . With all the terms . ' When pressed on whether it was his decision , he added : ` it 's not as clean as that . I can not speak to you about that now because that will not help us to win on sunday .

Cesc fabregas returns to arsenal on sunday and arsene wenger hopes fans will give him a good reception .

A number of intriguing strands run through this coming clash and could be pulled apart on full time . Here sportsmail assesses ten key questions and tries to provide some answers . Can manuel pellegrini survive a derby loss ? The word is the chilean 's future will be decided come may when the dust on a creaking season has settled . Defeat to cross - town rivals would push chairman khaldoon al mubarak closer to pressing the termination button though . It would leave city trailing united by four points and likely to finish fourth , needing to get past a qualifying round to reach to champions league - - the very minimum requirement . Manuel pellegrini ( centre ) is a man under - pressure at city and a defeat to their rivals is unthinkable . Who needs the win more ? To that end you would probably have to say city . A victory would inject some happiness into what seems a rather glum situation , and reignite ambitions to finish second , possible saving pellegrini from the axe . United look set to finish in the top four regardless , the baseline attainment for this campaign to be judged satisfactory . But they will be desperate to alter that current ugly sequence against their noisy neighbours . United have never lost five in a row to city before . Three points would begin to make their season look very decent indeed . Glenn murray ( right ) tormented city at selhurst park as they dropped out of the premier league title race .

       "  'ref_summ': \"It is not a match to decide the title , as has been the case in earlier seasons . But the manchester derby this sunday still holds great significance for both clubs , managers and , of course , supporters . City have won the last four contests between the sides , as well as the previous three at old trafford . A number of intriguing strands run through this coming clash and could be pulled apart on full time . Here sportsmail assesses ten key questions and tries to provide some answers . Can manuel pellegrini survive a derby loss ? The word is the chilean 's future will be decided come may when the dust on a creaking season has settled . Defeat to cross - town rivals would push chairman khaldoon al mubarak closer to pressing the termination button though . It would leave city trailing united by four points and likely to finish fourth , needing to get past a qualifying round to reach to champions league - - the very minimum requirement . Manuel pellegrini ( centre ) is a man under - pressure at city and a defeat to their rivals is unthinkable . Who needs the win more ? To that end you would probably have to say city . A victory would inject some happiness into what seems a rather glum situation , and reignite ambitions to finish second , possible saving pellegrini from the axe . United look set to finish in the top four regardless , the baseline attainment for this campaign to be judged satisfactory .
